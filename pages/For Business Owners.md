    <label for="accordion1">What cases will the Commitee Against Profiteering (CAP) investigate? </label>
    <div>
      <p>The CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases of essential goods and services that use the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a cover. 
			</p>
      <p>A number of factors could lead to price increases, such as an increase in operating costs including wages, utilities, rental, materials. 
			</p>
			<p>When a business raises its prices, it is not acceptable for businesses to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after the GST implementation, citing the GST as the reason.
			</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
    <label for="accordion2">How should I explain a price increase? </label>
    <div>
      <p>Businesses should be transparent with their prices. Sharing the following information will help consumers understand the reasons of your price increase:
			</p>
			<p>
				•	Why are you raising your prices?<br>
				•	What is the effective date of the price increase?<br>
				•	What is the price before and after the price increase?
			</p>
			<p>
				You must not misrepresent the reasons for any price increase as this will mislead consumers.

    <label for="accordion4">I received an email/SMS from the CAP. How do I know it is genuine? </label>
    <div>
      <p> Some businesses may receive emails from the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) via CASE’s official email address with the domain “@case.org.sg”. A representative from the People’s Association may also approach you for further clarifications.
