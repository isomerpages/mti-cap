    <label for="accordion1">What cases will the Commitee Against Profiteering (CAP) investigate? </label>
    <div>
      <p>The CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases of essential goods and services that use the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a cover. 
			</p>
      <p>A number of factors could lead to price increases, such as an increase in operating costs including wages, utilities, rental and materials. 
			</p>
			<p>If a business raises its prices, it is not acceptable for the business to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the GST implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after the GST implementation, citing the GST as the reason.

    <input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
    <label for="accordion2">How should I explain a price increase? </label>
    <div>
      <p>Businesses should be transparent with their prices. Sharing the following information will help consumers understand the reasons for your price increase:
			</p>
			<p>
				•	Why are you raising your price?<br>
				•	What is the effective date of the price increase?<br>
				•	What is the price before and after the price increase?
			</p>
			<p>
				You must not misrepresent the reasons for any price increase as this will mislead consumers.
