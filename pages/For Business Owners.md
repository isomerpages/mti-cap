    <label for="accordion1">What cases will CAP investigate? </label>
    <div>
      <p>CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases, using the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as an excuse. 
			</p>
      <p>A number of factors could lead to price increases, such as an increase in operating costs including wages, utilities, rental, materials. 
			</p>
			<p>When a business raises its prices, it should be upfront and transparent with consumers about its actions and its pricing rationale. It is not acceptable for businesses to use the GST increase as an excuse for raising prices before the GST implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after implementation, citing the GST as the reason.

    <label for="accordion2">How should I explain a price increase? </label>
    <div>
      <p>Businesses should be transparent with their prices. Sharing the following information will help consumers understand the reasons of your price increase:
			</p>
			<p>
				•	Why are you raising your prices?<br>
				•	What is the effective date of the price increase?<br>
				•	What is the price before and after the price increase?
			</p>
			<p>
				You must not misrepresent the reasons for any price increase as this will mislead consumers and go against the principles of transparency and a level playing field.
