**What is CAP?**

The Committee Against GST Profiteering (CAP) was reconvened on XX February 2022, to investigate feedback on alleged profiteering or unjustified price increases of  essential products and services, using the upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase as an excuse. 

CAP was first set up in 1994 with the introduction of GST, and was reconvened during previous rounds of GST increases in 2003 and 2007. The present committee comprises Members of Parliament (MPs), and representatives from the industry and grassroots organisations.

**What does CAP do?**

CAP investigates feedback on alleged profiteering or unjustified price increases of essential products and services. They include products like rice, chicken and bread, amongst other common items we consume. This basket of items is closely monitored by the Department of Statistics (DOS) via the monthly <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/consumer-price-index">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a>.

**How does CAP carry out an investigation?**

CAP will work with various agencies and organisations, including the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, the Consumers Association of Singapore and the Peopleâ€™s Association to assess the feedback provided in relation to alleged profiteering or unjustified price increases and engage with the relevant businesses where necessary. As part of the investigation process, CAP will evaluate the explanations provided by the business for the price increase, to determine if it constitutes profiteering. CAP will not hesitate to make public the list of errant businesses.
