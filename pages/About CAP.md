The CAP will focus on essential food items commonly consumed by Singaporean households, such as eggs, chicken vegetables and meals from hawker centres and coffee shops, as we as non-food essentials like household products. It will review and investigate feedback on unjustified price increases of essential products and services that use the GST increase as a cover.

The CAP will not add any regulatory burden on businesses. Its role is to strengthen transparency and enable free market competition to unction as it should. 

**How does CAP carry out an investigation?**

The CAP will work with partner agencies and organisations, including the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), the People’s Association (PA), and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), to assess feedback provided in relation to unjustified price increases using the GST increase as a cover, and engage with the relevant businesses where necessary.

As part of the investigation process, the CAP will evaluate the explanations provided by the business for the price increase, to determine if it constitutes profiteering. The CAP may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer on the pretext of the GST increase.
