    <div>
      <p>The CAP will investigate all allegations of unjustified price increases of essential goods and services, using the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a cover. </p>
      <p>A number of factors could lead to price increases, such as an increase in operating costs including wages, utilities, rental, materials. </p>
			<p>When a business raises its prices, it is not acceptable for businesses to use the GST increase as the reason for raising prices before the GST implementation, nor is it acceptable for a business to raise prices by more than the GST after the GST implementation, citing the GST as the reason.</p>

    <label for="accordion5">How will the CAP follow up on the feedback raised?</label>
    <div>
			<p>CAP works closely with various agencies and organisations, including the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), the People’s Association (PA), and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), to assess the feedback provided on unjustified price increases using the GST increase as a cover, and engage the relevant businesses where necessary to find out reasons for the price increase. </p>
      <p>As part of the investigation process, CAP will evaluate the explanations provided by the business for the price increase, to determine if it constitutes GST profiteering. CAP may make public errant businesses that seek to profiteer on the pretext of the GST increase.</p>

			<p>A representative from the People’s Association may also approach you for further clarifications. If you are approached by persons who are assisting the CAP, you should ask for information about their agency / organisation and official identification.
