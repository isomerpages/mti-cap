#### **Scam Alert**

Beware of any scam call, email or SMS impersonating the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP). If you have any scam-related information, please call the Police Hotline at 1800-255-000, or submit it online at <a href="http://www.police.gov.sg/iwitness" target="_blank">www.police.gov.sg/iwitness</a>. For information on scams, members of public can visit&nbsp;[www.scamshield.gov.sg](http://www.scamshield.gov.sg/)&nbsp;or call the 24/7 ScamShield Helpline at 1799.

##### 1.   Scam call/ email / SMS made under the guise of the CAP

There will be an acknowledgement email and SMS to those who provide their feedback through the official CAP feedback form on FormSG. The CAP will not send you any email or SMS asking you to click on any link or provide any information outside of the CAP website and the official CAP feedback form on FormSG. 

The CAP will not call you unless you have provided feedback through the official CAP feedback form on FormSG, or if you have requested a call-back. If you do receive a call from the CAP, you may wish to ask the caller to verify the Response ID (if applicable) of your feedback, or when your call-back request was made.

A representative from the People’s Association (PA) may also approach you for further clarifications. You can contact PA at 6225 5322 (Mondays to Sundays, except Public Holidays, 8am to 6pm) to verify their identity. PA will not send you any email or SMS asking you to click on any link or ask for any personal information.

##### 2.   Scam visits made to businesses under the guise of the CAP

Some businesses may receive emails from the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) via CASE’s official Email address
with the domain “@case.org.sg”. A representative from the PA may also approach you for further clarifications. You can contact CASE at 9795 8397 (Mondays to Fridays, except Public Holidays, 9am to 5pm) or PA at 6225 5322 (Mondays to Sundays, except Public Holidays, 8am to 6pm) to verify their identity.
